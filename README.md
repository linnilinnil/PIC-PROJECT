# NIH GRANTS & FUNDINGS DATA
(PIC16B Project - marlene, sharon, skylar, kara)

Inspired by the comments from [this NIH blog](https://nexus.od.nih.gov/all/2022/01/18/inequalities-in-the-distribution-of-national-institutes-of-health-research-project-grant-funding/), we build a dashboard based on the NIH research project grants & fundings data to address some questions asked by health science researchers regarding the resource distribution.   

To run the dashboard locally:

We suggest you to create a separate virtual environment running Python 3 for this app, and install all of the required dependencies there.


Run in Terminal/Command Prompt:

`git clone -b main https://github.com/linnilinnil/NIH-Fundings-Dashboard.git`

Enter the directory:

`cd NIH-Fundings-Dashboard`



`python3 -m virtualenv venv`

In UNIX system:

`source venv/bin/activate`

In Windows:

`venv\Scripts\activate`



To install all of the required packages to this environment, simply run:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

and all of the required pip packages will be installed. 

The app will be able to run by running the *app.py* file directly.  

`python3 app.py`
